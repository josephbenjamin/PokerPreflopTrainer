# Poker Preflop Trainer

- The Poker Preflop Trainder is a minimalist tool that allows the user to practice making preflop betting decisions in Texas Hold'em Poker.
- The main input is a 13x13 matrix, which we call a strategy grid. The grid defines the decisions to be made in a specific table position and scenario.
- Once the strategy is defined, the tool allows for rapid drilling of these bet vs. fold decisions.
